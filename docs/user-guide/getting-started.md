Save time by quickly identifying proposal quality before committing to detailed evaluation.

### **Options**

- Budget is poorly justified or unreasonable
- Impact claims are not supported by evidence

- Incomplete proposal

### **Early Exit**
For low-quality proposals, you can submit an early review and move to the next proposal, saving time for promising ones.

Each proposal is evaluated across six dimensions using a -3 to +3 scale:
